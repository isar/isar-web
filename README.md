The web bindings for the Isar database, a multi-platform, type-safe abstraction over native
capabilities. See https://isar.dev for more info.

This project is a stub currently; any code it may have is likely dysfunctional, untested, or
both. 

This currently uses TypeScript as its primary language, ESLint for linting, and [intern](https://github.com/theintern/intern) for testing. There is configuration files present in the repository for each of these tools.
